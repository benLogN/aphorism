### Add more aphorisms

```
$ which aphorism
/path/to/bin/aphorism
cd /path/to/lib/content
[text editor of choice open command] aphorisms.txt
```

Add new content, separating each aphorism from the prior entry with a `%` symbol on a newline.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
